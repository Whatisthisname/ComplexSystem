    "Disinformation, misinformation and fake news are becoming an increasingly pressing issue, particularly due to today’s nature of information sharing, which has been critically changed by the proliferation of social media and the advent of quick content generated by Artificial Intelligence. The increased spread of false content leads to the polarisation of political views, which can have a profound impact on democratic processes as well as increase the risk of political instability and reduce social cohesion. \n",

    "# Methodology\n",
    "The framework utilises a dynamic mean-field framework with a Three-State Potts Model to simulate disinformation adoption on a social network graph. This approach divides the population into three belief categories: adoption, rejection, and neutrality of the disinformed belief. This approach also incorporated a heterogeneous coupling strength, meaning the coupling strength accounts for hubs which exert stronger pulling forces, thus closer mirroring the dynamics of real-world scale-free networks. Furthermore, this study also closely simulates human psychology through memory effects, where a memory coefficient allows an individual’s prior beliefs to influence their current state. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations will be conducted, which will allow for the observation of transient dynamics.  \n",
    "The original study will be extended by adding temporal dynamics through a decay function applied to the memory effects function. While the initial model utilises memory effect to reinforce a belief, the extended model will argue that information overload leads to the degeneration of social bonds. Namely, if a node is faced with too much conflicting information, it can experience numbness and overstimulation, where the disoriented individual is less responsive to their peer’s influence. To address the research question, this new model will be compared to the baseline model introduced by Evangelatos et al.. This comparison will aim to investigate how the critical threshold and giant component formation are influenced by the introduction of the new memory fatigue function. \n",
